# Data-Cleaning-Pandas
Tools used: _Python, Pandas, Juyper Notebook_

This was a projects I wanted to explore data cleaning in python, using Pandas. My goal was to try and replicate the work I did in SQL and translate it into Pandas in order to:
1) Fully understand the code I was writing and working with, going from something I do understand to something I was less familiar with.
2) To later find new and more efficiant ways of writing the code after I understood it better.

What I did was:
- Change and standardize Date formats
- Populate missing/NULL data, based on values from other columns _(property address data)_
- Breaking out text data into individual columns _(address, city, state)_
- Standardize and change text data _(example change text from 'Y' to 'Yes')_
- Remove Duplicates
- Delete unused columns

### Learning outcomes
---
- Getting more comfortable with the framework Pandas
- Learning how to translate code from SQL to Pandas _(what I needed to change, what I could/coulnd't do)_
- Learning new ways of writing the same code (i.e. more efficiant ways compared to my translated code)
