# Data-Cleaning-Pandas
Tools used: _Python, Pandas, Juyper Notebook_

This was a projects I wanted to explore data cleaning in python, using Pandas. My goal was to try and replicate the work I did in SQL and translate it into Pandas.

What I did was:

Change and standardize Date formats
Populate missing/NULL data _(property address data)_
- Based on values from other columns
Breaking out text data into individual columns _(address, city, state)_
Standardize and change text data _(example change text from 'Y' to 'Yes')_
Remove Duplicates
Delete unused columns
